This project is Flask-driven. Flask stands out from other frameworks because it lets developer take the drive'rs seat and have full creative control of their application.Maybe you have heard the phrase "fighting the framework" before. This happens with most frameworks when you decide to solve a problem with a solution that isn't an official one Flask is not like that.

* First you must install Flask & Python3 and then install everything from requirements.txt file using Python's package installer (also known as pip).
*Example: pip install package_name.
